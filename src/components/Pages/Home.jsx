          Navigating the world of stock investing can feel like drowning in data.
          Traditional financial tools and stock screeners often bombard you with
          so much information that finding a truly promising investment feels
          impossible. We've been there â€“ staring at endless spreadsheets and
          combing through financial statements, wondering:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Is a company with $100 million in operating income a hidden gem, or a
            ticking time bomb?
          </li>
          <li>How much debt is too much debt?</li>
          <li>What do declining operating margins really tell you?</li>
          <li>
            And with all the hype, are you missing out if you're not just buying
            the "Magnificent 7"?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These are vital questions, but finding the answers shouldn't require a
          finance degree or countless hours of research. We believe that
          identifying fundamentally strong businesses should be straightforward,
          even for new and aspiring investors.
